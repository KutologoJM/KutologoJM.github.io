## My Projects

### [ONI RECIPE API]({{ '/oni-recipes-api' | relative_url }})

A simple REST API for managing food recipes in Oxygen Not Included.
This API is a part of the suite of tools available in my ONI-IAMS project, and this will serve as its standalone
showcase.

stock. It shall be used to keep track of resources in Oxygen Not Included. A sandbox game with a wide range of food
items, recipes, materials to create. A perfect testing ground to mimic a real business flow.
